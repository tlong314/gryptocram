# gryptocram.js
An easy-to-use JavaScript library to add working cryptogram puzzles to your webpage.

You can add a puzzle to any visible element on your page. To use the built-in styles in the gryptocram.css file just add the class "grypt-host" to the element where the puzzle will be stored.

The user's progress on a puzzle is immediately saved in the browser's local storage, so they can continue later.

Note: the current version only supports adding one puzzle per page.
