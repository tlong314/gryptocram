# gryptocram.js
An easy-to-use JavaScript library to add cryptogram puzzles to your webpage.

You can add a puzzle to any block-level element on your page. To use the built-in styles you should add the class "grypt-host" to the element where the puzzle will be stored.

Note: the current version only supports adding one puzzle per page.
